                and needs a bone marrow transplant. The family’s insurance company refuses to cover
                the transplant. To prepare Anna for the bone marrow donation, Sara gives her
                growth-factor shots. Six-year-old Anna tells Sara she hates her. Sara’s sister,
                Zanne, offers to pay for the transplant, but Brian tells Sara the men at the
                fire-station raised enough money. Sara takes Kate to the hospital to begin her
                pre-transplant regimen of chemotherapy. Before she leaves the house, Kate cleans her

11587,Why does Jesse walk into traffic?,"Jesse steals a dump truck and picks up Dan. In flashbacks, Jesse recalls when
                he was eleven and received a skateboard as a “guilt gift,” meaning a gift his
                parents gave him whenever Kate became seriously ill. Brian promised him he would
                take him to a parking lot where he could ride it, but Kate’s nose started to bleed. When Jesse reminded Brian of his promise, Brian looked at Jesse like he didn’t see
                him. That day, Jesse walked into the middle of traffic, hoping to get noticed. In
                the present, Jesse takes Dan to a shed. Jesse lights it on fire and admires his
                work, until Dan tells him that a homeless man named Rat lives in there. Jesse runs

11607,"Why does Zeus kill Apollo’s son, Aesculapius?","Apollo once loved a mortal woman named Coronis who, for
a change, cheats on him. He learns of the treachery and kills her
but saves her unborn child. He takes the infant boy, Aesculapius,
to the centaur Chiron, who raises him and trains him in the arts
of medicine. Aesculapius is such a good doctor that he raises a
man, Theseus’s son Hippolytus, from the dead. Because this is a
power no mortal should have, the angry Zeus strikes Aesculapius
dead with a thunderbolt. Apollo, enraged at his son’s death, attacks
the Cyclopes, makers of Zeus’s thunderbolts. Zeus condemns Apollo
to serve as a slave to King Admetus for a number of years. ",Aesculapius stole from Zeus,Aesculapius revived the dead,Aesculapius betrayed Apollo,Aesculapius insulted Zeus,1
11608,What was Erysichthon’s punishment for cutting down Ceres’ sacred giant oak tree?,"Erysichthon dared to cut down Ceres’ (Demeter’s) sacred
giant oak tree. As punishment, Ceres condemns him to starve to death,
no matter how much food he eats. He sells everything he has, including his
daughter, for food. His daughter prays to Poseidon to free her from
slavery, and the god helps her by transforming her into a fisherman
so that her master will not recognize her. She returns to her father,
and they perpetrate the scheme again and again: Erysichthon sells
her into slavery, and she then transforms and escapes. Erysichthon
remains hungry, however, and he finally dies of starvation.",He is always starving,He cannot die,He loses his sight,He cannot move,0
11620,"Every winter, Demeter is filled with sorrow: why?","Hades, wanting a queen, kidnaps Demeter’s only child,
Persephone. Demeter wanders the earth in aimless despair, eventually resting
in Eleusis in human disguise. One day, the kind family that has
been harboring her accidentally discovers her divine nature and offends
her. They build the great temple at Eleusis to appease her anger. Still, Demeter locks herself in the temple out of sadness, and at
that time nothing grows on the earth. Finally, Zeus sends Hermes down
to Hades to try to set everything right. Hades agrees to let Persephone
return to her mother but slyly makes her eat a magic pomegranate
seed that necessitates her return. Eventually a compromise is arranged:
Persephone will stay with Hades for one-third of the year, Demeter
for the other two-thirds. When Persephone returns to the underworld
at the start of each winter, Demeter’s renewed sorrow makes the
Earth barren. Persephone returns each spring, causing Demeter’s
joy and thus the springtime’s blossoming.",Cold weather,Her husband leaves,Persephone joins her,Persephone goes to Hades,3
11644,How does Hercules die?,"Hamilton draws her story of Hercules mostly from later
writers but also borrows from Greek tragedians. Hercules, born in
Thebes, is the son of Zeus and Alcmene, a mortal whom Zeus deceives
by disguising himself as her husband. Hercules’ demi-god status
allows him many liberties. He can challenge the gods and often win,
as when he offends the Oracle at Delphi and quarrels with Apollo. He also helps the gods defeat the giants with his superhuman strength; above
all else, he is remembered as the strongest man who ever lived. Only
magic can harm him, as he overpowers all else. His unequalled strength
makes up for deficiencies in intelligence and patience—he can be
impetuous, emotional, and careless, and once threatens to shoot
an arrow at the sun because it is too hot. Nonetheless, he has boundless
courage and a noble sense of right and wrong.",The Labors of Hercules,Hades kills him,Zeus kills him,He kills himself,3
11648,Where does Zeus’s allegiance lie in the Trojan War?,"The prophet Calchas then tells the Greeks that they must
capture the Trojan prophet Helenus in order to win. They do so,
and Helenus tells them that Troy can only be defeated by the bow
and arrows of Hercules. Hercules gave these weapons to Philoctetes,
who set out for Troy with the Greeks, who abandoned him along the
way. Odysseus and a few others set out to apologize and get him
back. Philoctetes returns and promptly kills Paris. The Greeks learn
that the Trojans have a sacred image of Athena, the Palladium, that
protects them. Odysseus and Diomedes sneak behind enemy lines and steal
it. Yet Troy still has the protection of its gigantic walls, which prevent
the Greeks from entering. Finally, Odysseus comes up with a plan
to build a giant wooden horse and roll it up to the gates, pretending
they have surrendered and gone home. One man, Sinon, stays behind,
acting as if he is a traitor to the Greeks. He says that although
the Greeks retreated, they left the horse as an offering to Athena. He says the Greeks assumed the Trojans would not take it inside
the city because of its size, which would thus offend Athena and
bring misfortune on the city. Trojans, feeling like they are getting
the last laugh, triumphantly bring the horse into the city.",He is neutral,With the Greeks,With fate,With the Trojans,3
